description: "In double entry bookkeeping, debits and credits (abbreviated Dr and\
  \ Cr, respectively) are entries made in account ledgers to record changes in value\
  \ resulting from business transactions. Generally speaking, the source for spending\
  \ money in a transaction in the account is credit (that is, an entry is made on\
  \ the right side of the account's ledger), and what the money obtained with the\
  \ credit is described as a debit (that is, an entry is made on the left side). Credits\
  \ could be share capital, revenues, etc., while debits could be assets, dividends,\
  \ and so on. From a technical point of view, the sides refer to the balance sheet\
  \ placement of accounts. Total debits must equal total credits for each transaction;\
  \ individual transactions may require multiple debit and credit entries.\nThe difference\
  \ between the total debits and total credits in a single account is the account's\
  \ balance. If debits exceed credits, the account has a debit balance; if credits\
  \ exceed debits, the account has a credit balance. For the company as a whole, the\
  \ totals of debit balances and credit balances must be equal as shown in the trial\
  \ balance report, otherwise an error has occurred.\nAccountants use the trial balance\
  \ to prepare financial statements.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
